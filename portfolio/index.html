				<div class="content"><h2><em>About me</em></h2>
		<p>As a Concordia University in St. Paul graduate; I studied my
undergraduate in Information and Technology Management.
Concordia university program focused on project management,
information systems management, database management,
financial systems management, cloud analysis, and
programming. </p>
		<p>Technology has always been a passion of mine. Whether it be setting up a new router,
building a computer or learning something new from a free online class. I always jump on a chance to experience
something new when it comes to technology.</p></div>

			<div class="content"><h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
		<p>I started my technology career at Hennepin technical college.
At Hennepin technical college I started to learn about a variety of different areas.
These included; Python programming, Windows administration, networking, computer hardware and software. 
As my enjoyment for technology grew, I applied at Concordia University St. Paul. 
At Concordia, I was able to grow within many different areas of technology. 
These included; databases, system security, learning how to create business plan and information systems.  </p>
		<p>In June of 2015, I got my first opportunity to join the technology field. I got hired on as an intern at Epicor software.
My role started as a database load team member. 
Every database that a customer needed to get tested by an analyst at Epicor needed to be loaded onto our servers. 
This role eventually turned into a fulltime technical support analyst position. I am now helping customers resolve issues within their environment. </p></div>

			<div class="content"><h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
			<p>I have many different hobbies, they all keep me really busy during the changing seasons. 
		I enjoy all sports, whether it be playing ice hockey on a frozen pond or watching 
the vikings on Sundays. I would say that I have over 15 different types of sports jerseys. These range from all different teams throughout the US. 
I also love the outdoors, I bought a new moutain bike that I love to take along with me on my adventures. 
During the summer months when I have open weekend, you'll probably find me in a tent, near a lake, with a fishing pole.</p>
		<p>My other passion is technology. I always love being tested when it comes to technology. Whether it be setting up new routers for friends,
playing games on Xbox and my computer, or trying to solve the little issues my Mom has with her Ipad. During the winter you will probably find me
on one of the free websites that offers courses on new subjects.</p></div>
